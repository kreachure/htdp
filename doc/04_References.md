# Self-Reference
## Goals:
* Be able to use list mechanisms to construct and destruct lists
* Be able to identify problem domain information of arbitrary size that should be represented using lists and lists of structures
* Be able to use HtDD, HtDF and Design Driven Templates recipes with such data
* Be able to explain what makes a self-referential data definition well-formed and identify whether a particular self-referential data definition is well-formed
* Be able to design functions that consume and produce lists and list structures
* Be able to predict and identify correspondence between self-references in a data definition and natural recursions in functions that operate on the data
